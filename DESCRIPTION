Description: Function that recodes GSS family of variables for religious
    identification (base variables: relig, denom, and other; for
    respondent, spouse, parents, etc.) into a 7 (and 12) level sociological
    classification built by Sherkat and Lehman. Coding scheme avoids
    conflation with politicized religious identities and facilitates
    analyses of change over time. It automatically handels combination of
    punches and levels, supplies classification key, and so on. See original
    article, website, documentation, and examples for more details.
